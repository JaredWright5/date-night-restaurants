# Venice Filtering Issue - Investigation Summary

## Problem
The URL `https://datenightrestaurants.com/losangeles/restaurants/?neighborhood=Venice` shows all 117 restaurants instead of filtering to only the 13 Venice restaurants.

## Investigation Results

### ✅ Data is Correct
- JSON file contains 13 Venice restaurants with `"neighborhood": "Venice"`
- Data processing in `src/data/restaurants.ts` preserves the neighborhood field correctly
- Confirmed with test script: `node test-data-processing.mjs` shows 13 Venice restaurants after processing

### ✅ Filtering Logic is Correct
- `searchRestaurants()` function in `src/data/restaurants.ts` has correct neighborhood filtering logic (lines 197-201)
- Server-side filtering code in `src/pages/losangeles/restaurants/index.astro` looks correct (lines 34-42)

### ❌ Issue: Server-Side Filtering Not Working
- Despite correct logic, the page shows all 117 restaurants
- The `allRestaurants.length` in the HTML is 117, meaning the filtering is not being applied
- Console.log statements added for debugging are not visible in HTML output (they log to server console)

## Root Cause Hypothesis
The issue appears to be that:
1. The URL parameters ARE being read correctly
2. The filtering condition IS being met
3. BUT the `searchRestaurants()` function is either:
   - Not being called
   - Not returning filtered results
   - Being overridden by something else

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Check Server Console Logs**: Look at the actual Astro dev server console output to see the console.log statements
2. **Test searchRestaurants Directly**: Create a test to call `searchRestaurants('', { neighborhood: 'Venice' })` and verify it returns 13 restaurants
3. **Check for Caching Issues**: The Astro dev server might be caching the page
4. **Verify Build Output**: Build the site and check if the issue persists in production

## Temporary Workaround
Use the neighborhood-specific URLs instead of query parameters:
- ✅ WORKS: `https://datenightrestaurants.com/neighborhoods/venice/restaurants/`
- ❌ BROKEN: `https://datenightrestaurants.com/losangeles/restaurants/?neighborhood=Venice`

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/losangeles/restaurants/index.astro` - Added extensive debugging
- `test-data-processing.mjs` - Created to verify data processing
- `test-filtering.js` - Created to test filtering logic (not working due to module issues)
