            <h2>First Date Restaurant Tips: Do's and Don'ts</h2>
            
            <h3>‚úÖ DO:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Make a reservation:</strong> Shows you're organized and considerate. Nothing kills the mood like a 45-minute wait.</li>
              <li><strong>Choose a place with options:</strong> Pick somewhere with a diverse menu so dietary restrictions aren't an issue.</li>
              <li><strong>Consider the noise level:</strong> You want to hear each other! Avoid places known for being too loud.</li>
              <li><strong>Pick a convenient location:</strong> Choose somewhere roughly between both of you, or easy for your date to get to.</li>
              <li><strong>Arrive 5 minutes early:</strong> Being on time (or slightly early) shows respect and helps you feel composed.</li>
              <li><strong>Have a backup plan:</strong> Know a nearby bar or coffee shop in case dinner goes really well (or really poorly).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>‚ùå DON'T:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Choose somewhere too expensive:</strong> Creates pressure about who pays and can feel like you're trying too hard.</li>
              <li><strong>Pick a place that's too trendy:</strong> Long waits, loud music, and scene-y crowds aren't conducive to conversation.</li>
              <li><strong>Go somewhere with a complicated menu:</strong> You want to focus on your date, not deciphering the menu.</li>
              <li><strong>Choose a place you've never been:</strong> If possible, pick somewhere you've tried so you know what to expect.</li>
              <li><strong>Suggest somewhere too casual:</strong> Fast food or food courts suggest you didn't put thought into the date.</li>
              <li><strong>Book during peak hours:</strong> 7-8 PM on Friday/Saturday is the busiest. Consider 6 PM or 8:30 PM instead.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conversation Starters for First Dates</h2>
            <p>
              Once you've chosen the perfect restaurant, here are some conversation topics that work well over dinner:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Food and Travel:</strong> "Have you tried [cuisine type] before?" or "What's the best meal you've ever had?"</li>
              <li><strong>The Restaurant Itself:</strong> "How did you hear about this place?" or "What looks good to you?"</li>
              <li><strong>LA Life:</strong> "What neighborhood do you live in?" or "What's your favorite thing about LA?"</li>
              <li><strong>Interests and Hobbies:</strong> "What do you like to do on weekends?" or "Any hidden gems you'd recommend?"</li>
              <li><strong>Future Plans:</strong> "Have you been to [nearby attraction]?" (sets up potential second date)</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Budget Considerations</h2>
            <p>
              First dates don't need to be expensive to be impressive. Here's what to expect at different price points:
            </p>

            <h3>$ ($20-$40 per person)</h3>
            <p>
              Casual spots with excellent food. Great for coffee dates that turn into dinner or laid-back first meetings. Examples: Sqirl, Jon & Vinny's, Night + Market.
            </p>

            <h3>$$ ($40-$70 per person)</h3>
            <p>
              The sweet spot for first dates. Nice enough to impress, affordable enough to not stress about. Examples: Gjelina, Gracias Madre, Scopa Italian Roots.
            </p>

            <h3>$$$ ($70-$120 per person)</h3>
            <p>
              Upscale-casual spots that show you're serious about making a good impression. Examples: AOC Wine Bar, Felix Trattoria, The Little Door.
            </p>

            <h3>$$$$ ($120+ per person)</h3>
            <p>
              Save these for later dates unless you both agreed on fine dining. Can create pressure on a first date.

          <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Timing Your First Date</h2>
            
            <h3>Best Days</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Tuesday-Thursday:</strong> Restaurants are less crowded, service is more attentive, and the atmosphere is more relaxed. Perfect for conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sunday Brunch:</strong> Daytime dates feel lower pressure and give you a natural endpoint if things aren't clicking.
            </p>

            <h3>Best Times</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>6:00 PM:</strong> Early dinner means you can extend the date if it's going well (drinks after) or keep it short if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>8:30 PM:</strong> Later dinner feels more date-like and the restaurant is usually less crowded after the rush.

            <h2>Red Flags to Avoid</h2>
            <p>
              Some restaurants, while excellent, aren't ideal for first dates:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Overly loud venues:</strong> If you have to shout, you can't connect</li>
              <li><strong>Extremely expensive spots:</strong> Creates pressure and expectations</li>
              <li><strong>Places with limited menus:</strong> What if they don't like that cuisine?</li>
              <li><strong>Restaurants with long waits:</strong> Standing around awkwardly isn't romantic</li>
              <li><strong>Overly intimate settings:</strong> Save the candlelit corners for date 3+</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="content-section">
            <h2>What to Do After Dinner</h2>
            <p>
              If the date is going well, having a plan for after dinner shows confidence:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Santa Monica/Venice:</strong> Walk on the beach or pier</li>
              <li><strong>Downtown LA:</strong> Rooftop bar or arts district gallery walk</li>
              <li><strong>Hollywood:</strong> Griffith Observatory for views</li>
              <li><strong>West Hollywood:</strong> Cocktail bar or live music venue</li>
              <li><strong>Anywhere:</strong> Coffee or dessert at a nearby spot</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              The perfect first date restaurant is one where you both feel comfortable being yourselves. While ambiance and food matter, what really counts is whether the setting allows you to connect and enjoy each other's company. The restaurants on this list have been chosen specifically because they create that magic balance.
            </p>

            <p>
              Remember: the restaurant is just the backdrop. Your genuine interest in getting to know your date, your conversation skills, and your ability to be present matter far more than whether you chose the trendiest spot in town. Pick a place from this list, relax, and enjoy getting to know someone new.
