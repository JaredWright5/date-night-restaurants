# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Cloudflare Pages Deployment Issue

## Problem
Cloudflare Pages is stuck deploying commit `554ef69` instead of the latest code with all the bug fixes.

## Solution: Update Cloudflare Pages Settings

### Step 1: Access Cloudflare Pages Dashboard
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Select your account
3. Click on **"Workers & Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. Click on your **"date-night-restaurants"** project

### Step 2: Check Current Deployment Settings
1. Click on the **"Settings"** tab
2. Look for **"Builds & deployments"** section
3. Check the **"Production branch"** setting
4. Check if there's a specific commit SHA configured

### Step 3: Fix the Configuration
**Option A: Change Production Branch**
1. Make sure **"Production branch"** is set to `main` (not a specific commit)
2. Save the changes

**Option B: Manually Trigger New Deployment**
1. Go to the **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click **"Create deployment"** button
3. Select **"main"** branch
4. Make sure it shows the latest commit: `4e6246c` or newer
5. Click **"Deploy"**

**Option C: Retry Latest Deployment**
1. Go to the **"Deployments"** tab
2. Find the most recent deployment
3. Click the **"..."** menu
4. Click **"Retry deployment"**
5. Make sure it's deploying from the latest commit

### Step 4: Verify the Fix
After redeploying, check the build logs to ensure:
1. It's cloning the correct commit (should be `4e6246c` or `06a4267`, NOT `554ef69`)
2. The build completes successfully
3. All 100+ restaurant pages are generated

## Alternative: Delete and Recreate Deployment
If the above doesn't work:

1. Go to **"Settings"** â†’ **"Builds & deployments"**
2. Scroll down to **"Deployment triggers"**
3. Click **"Add trigger"**
4. Set it to deploy on every push to `main` branch

## Expected Build Output
When it works correctly, you should see:
```
HEAD is now at 4e6246c Fix wrangler.toml configuration for Cloudflare Pages
```
OR
```
HEAD is now at 06a4267 Force Cloudflare deployment with latest fixes
```

NOT:
```
HEAD is now at 554ef69 Restructure URLs to datenightrestaurants.com/losangeles/restaurant-name
```

## Why This Happened
Cloudflare Pages seems to have cached or pinned the deployment to a specific commit SHA (`554ef695f66ab327ab6d4da91d2997b48b75cc4f`), which doesn't include the error handling fixes we added in commits `defee03`, `06a4267`, and `4e6246c`.

## What's in the Latest Code
The latest commits include:
- âœ… Error handling for undefined restaurant data
- âœ… Null checks for opening hours
- âœ… Fallbacks for missing reviews
- âœ… Fixed wrangler.toml configuration
- âœ… New URL structure `/losangeles/restaurant-name/`

## Need Help?
If you're still seeing issues after trying these steps, you may need to:
1. Clear Cloudflare's build cache
2. Contact Cloudflare support
3. Or, as a last resort, create a new Cloudflare Pages project pointing to the same GitHub repository
